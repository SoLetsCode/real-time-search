          In the second book, Rowling establishes that Voldemort hates
          non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000
          interview with the BBC, Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating
          bully: "Well I think it is often the case that the biggest bullies
          take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they
          put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other
          and that's what Voldemort does."[9] In the same year, Rowling became
          more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life
          tyrants, describing him as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal
          human responses to other people's suffering".[10] In 2004, though,
          Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person.[11]
          In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a
          human fear: the fear of death. She said: "Voldemort's fear is death,
          ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He
          thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst
          fear is death."[12]

          Throughout the series, Rowling establishes that Voldemort is so feared
          in the wizarding world that it is considered dangerous even to speak
          his name. Most characters in the novels refer to him as "You-Know-Who"
          or "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" rather than say his name aloud. In Harry
          Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a "taboo" spell is placed upon the
          name, such that Voldemort or his followers may trace anyone who utters
          it. By this means, his followers eventually find and capture Harry and
          his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. In the second book,
          Rowling reveals that I am Lord Voldemort is an anagram of the
          character's birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. According to the author,
          Voldemort's name is an invented word.[13] Some literary analysts have
          considered possible meanings in the name: Philip Nel believes that
          Voldemort is derived from the French for "flight of death",[14] and in
          a 2002 paper, Nilsen and Nilsen suggest that readers get a "creepy
          feeling" from the name Voldemort, because of the French word "mort"
          ("death") within it and that word's association with cognate English
          words derived from the Latin mors.[15]
